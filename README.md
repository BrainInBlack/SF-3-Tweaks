# SF 3 Tweaks

Not everybody can play for 8 to 16 hours a day and these
tweaks/changes were made for those kind of people. Sieving rates where
doubled for many basic resources and some restrictions were removed or
rebalanced.

If you think a pack has to be "balanced",
then these tweaks are not for you!


## Changes

* Better Sieving Returns
* Excavate with all Tools
* Dust can be made in EnderIO Machines
* Silicon is made in the Resonator
* Yellorium emits heat again
* Yellorium Blocks are made in the Alloy Smelter


## Installation

Just copy the `config` and `scripts` folder to your Sky Factory 3
instance and overwrite if prompted.
__It is recommended to make a backup first!__
