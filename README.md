# SF 3 Tweaks

These Tweaks attempt to speedup the early-game just enough that people
with less time on their hand can still have fun with pack, while not
feeling like they made no progress in their rather short sessions.

However, some stuff is gated behind some involving processes to at
least make an effort to balance everything. The first hour or so, will
still be spend punching trees and twerking like a madman/madwoman. In
other words the spirit of the pack should be preserved.


## Changes

* Rebalanced Sieving Returns
  * Overall more Resources and less Gold
* Excavate with all Tools
  * There are issues with some tools (see Known Issues)
* Dust can be made in the SAG Mill
  * Brings everything more in line with other similar machines
* Silicon is made in the Resonator
  * Balances out the Dust making capabilities of the SAG Mill
* Yellorium emits decent amounts heat again
  * But are harder and more expensive to make


## Installation
###### It is recommended to make a backup first!

Just copy the `config` and `scripts` folder to your Sky Factory 3
instance and overwrite if prompted.


## Known Issues

* Blocks get eaten by the compressed hammer if durability runs out while excavating.
* Some tools behave weirdly if used for excavating.
